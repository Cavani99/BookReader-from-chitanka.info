# Program short explanation

## [Choose Book](https://github.com/Cavani99/BookReader-from-chitanka.info/blob/main/Main.java#L68) operation

A File Chooser Dialog opens up to choose the file you want to read.You can only open files with .txt extension.

When a correct text file is opened(from chitanka.info ,althought it is possible to recognize other text files as valid also),it prints the 
author`s name and the name of the book:

## [Load Chapters](https://github.com/Cavani99/BookReader-from-chitanka.info/blob/main/Main.java#L124) operation

If a text file is opened you can load the chapters of the book.The chapters are split by comparing the amount of empty lines and the length of the current line of the text file,and also depending of the first letter of the line.The chapter spliting is not perfect thought and will not always split the chapters as desired ,depending on the book.After a chapter is recognized it`s name and start position in the text is saved in a LinkedHashMap,and after the whole text file is read ,the contents of the LinkedHashMap are printed.


Chapters for Crime and Punishment:

## [Pick Chapter](https://github.com/Cavani99/BookReader-from-chitanka.info/blob/main/Main.java#L232) operation 

You can pick a chapter to read using an InputDialog.You need to write the number of the chapter ,depending of the position in the LinkedHashMap.I use the [getChapter](https://github.com/Cavani99/BookReader-from-chitanka.info/blob/main/Main.java#L424) method to see if this chapter exists in the LinkedHashMap ,and when it does, we print its information.
I also use the [splitLine](https://github.com/Cavani99/BookReader-from-chitanka.info/blob/main/Main.java#L269) method to shorten the length of the line,for better readability.

Part from Chapter II:

## [Next Chapter](https://github.com/Cavani99/BookReader-from-chitanka.info/blob/main/Main.java#L241) and [Previous Chapter](https://github.com/Cavani99/BookReader-from-chitanka.info/blob/main/Main.java#L250) buttons

Simply used to get the Next or the Previous Chapter ,compared to the current chapter loaded for reading.This is what we get,if we try to get the previous chapter of the first one:

You can also change the [maximum width](https://github.com/Cavani99/BookReader-from-chitanka.info/blob/main/Main.java#L352) of every line(that is the maximum amount of words)for more enjoyable reading experience, using the "Change Line Width" Item.
